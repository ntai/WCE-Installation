* Triage process

This is getting more stable.
The introduction of pre-installed disks will change the process and probably we'd need a few iterations, but the major part will stay the same.


* Automation of installation server update.

A flock of iServers need to update itself when the master server (wcemaster) is available.

The work has began under "iserver" but there is a long way to go.

* Disk imaging

With the netboot/disk imaging and standalone disk imaging provided, this one has gotten much better lately.
I still need to investigate why the new .lzo file is so much larger than the original

* Ping server

AFAIK, it' ping client seems to be working.
It needs clear documentation.

The server side remains the mistery. However, the log processing Python script is provided.


* Installation server setup

This area needs the installation automation and documentation.
A bootstrapper is provided but not complete by any means.


* Mini Installation Server

Bufferlo's LinkStation running Debian is working as an installation server.
The maintainance is all by hand. 
This also needs either a good documentation or automation of updates.


* Payload update procedure

Needs a doc write up how to create/update/maintain the disk image.
This is very likely not automatable.
Ubuntu part is doable, but the WCE contents is manual labor. 
WCE needs to learn providing the PPA packages so that WCE can ship the contents as Debian/Ubuntu packages.
Until then, it's manual.
