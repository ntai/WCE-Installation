WCE Clonezilla

The WCE triage/installer CD is based on the Clonezilla CD.
make downloads/extracts/modfies the Clonezilla CD and repackages
as the WCE Clonezilla CD.

The resulting CD contains WCE's triage/installer Python script,
"/wce.py", which is renamed from "install-ubuntu.py".

make targets:
"make" makes a modified CD.

"make debian"
"make prerequisits"
First time you run this, plase run "make debian prerequisits".
It installs necessary apt-key and packages.

"make tftp"
After making CD, you can set up the machine for installation
server. The squash file system image is copied to /var/lib/tftpboot.
It may install syslinux if needed.


BUGS:
The make process is not problem free.

depending on the Ubuntu version, some packages are organized
differently. I think the right thing to do is to move the
whole thing to the newest LTS based, and leave the old LTS
based as a branch in GIT. At the moment (2013-03), I have not
get around to do so.
