WCE Installation

To make installing software to the computers for World Computer Exchange.
Currently, WCE's computers are Ubuntu based linux + educational materials.
If one day, we use something else, it needs to be expanded.
However, the installer is also the WCE Boston's triage software, so it would
be unlikely to ditch Linux/Ubuntu as it supports wide range of hardware 
without requiring collection of drivers, like Windows.
