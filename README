WCE Installation

To make installing software to the computers for World Computer Exchange.
Currently, WCE's computers are Ubuntu based linux + educational materials.

The installer is also the WCE Boston's triage software, so it would
be unlikely to ditch Linux/Ubuntu as it supports wide range of hardware 
without requiring collection of drivers, like Windows.
