WCE Follow Up

The goal of this is to access a URL periodically from the computers
WCE installs.
It is simple that we have a python script that runs periodically.
To run periodically, we use cron.


How it works:

There are 4 files to install. 

/etc/rc.local
/usr/local/bin/wce-follow-up
/usr/local/bin/access-world-computer-exchange
/var/lib/world-computer-exchange/access-url

"/etc/rc.local" runs /usr/local/bin/wce-follow-up at machine
start up, and it does install crontab. It also sets up the
necessary directories, etc. for the periodic web access.

"/usr/local/bin/access-world-computer-exchange" is the python
script that accesses the WCE web site.
This is run by cron.

"/var/lib/world-computer-exchange/access-url" is the URL to
access.

access-world-computer-exchange uses two more files.
/var/lib/world-computer-exchange/computer-uuid
/var/lib/world-computer-exchange/access-timestamp

computer-uuid: This is the UUID of computer, and generated
using "uuidgen" command by "wce-follow-up" at start up if
it's not present. The UUID is random, so essentially each
computer get a complete random ID.

access-timestamp: This is the last successful PING access.

Once access-world-computer-exchange succeeds the PING,
it waits at least 23 days. (more than 3 weeks and less than
4 weeks, enough for once a month.)


How to install this:

A way to install these files is to create a tar file,
and (cd / ; tar xf wce-follow-up.tar) to put the all files.

Makefile included can produce the tar file with necessary
permissions, etc. so all you have to do is to untar at the
installation.

Alternatively, you can make the disk image with these files
already installed.
When you this, make sure to remove two files.

rm -f "/var/lib/world-computer-exchange/access-timestamp"
rm -f "/var/lib/world-computer-exchange/computer-uuid"



At the end:

Make sure your disk image to include uuidgen and wget package.
Both should be present if you do a Edubuntu installation, but
doesn't hurt to double-check when you create the disk image.
